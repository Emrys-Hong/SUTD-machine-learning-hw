machine learning homework for homework1

Hi Richard, you only need to run the code in *.ipynb.

1. Q1 is in Q1.ipynb
2. Q2 is in Q2.ipynb
3. Q3 is in Q3.ipynb

every cell must be run sequentially, because later code may require previous code to work.


If you have any questions please contact Pengfei :).

Required libs:
pandas
numpy
